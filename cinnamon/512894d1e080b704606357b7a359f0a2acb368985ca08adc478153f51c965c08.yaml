summary: This massive, 12-volume work on the flora of the Malabar coast was produced by a team of European and Indian scholars, supervised by Hendrik Adriaan van Rheede tot Drakenstein, and published between 1678 and 1703. The Indian botanist K.S. Manilal identified this species as Cinnamomum verum. Although this is the same species as the true cinnamon from Ceylon, Van Rheede's experiments with the oil from the root revealed differences between cinnamon from both locations.
